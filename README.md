# cljs-fake-news

A [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame) application based on an [old project](https://github.com/aarandela/fake-news/tree/deploy) when I first started out. [Play the old version](aarandela.github.io/fake-news/)

I wanted to rejuvenate this game in ClojureScript for more practice and add more features such as:

- Time Limit
- Difficulty 
- Show the articles of the news
- Possibly multiplayer and/or high score table
- Clean up the UI

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run watch
```

### Project Overview

* Architecture:
[Single Page Application (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
* Languages
  - Front end is [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) with ([re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame))
* Dependencies
  - UI framework: [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame)
  ([docs](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/README.md),
  [FAQs](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/FAQs/README.md)) ->
  [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) ->
  [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* Build tools
  - CLJS compilation, dependency management, REPL, & hot reload: [`shadow-cljs`](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs)
* Development tools
  - Debugging: [CLJS DevTools](https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools),
  [`re-frame-10x`](https://github.com/day8/re-frame-10x)

#### Directory structure

* [`/`](/../../): project config files
* [`dev/`](dev/): source files compiled only with the [dev](#running-the-app) profile
  - [`user.cljs`](dev/cljs/user.cljs): symbols for use during development in the
[ClojureScript REPL](#connecting-to-the-browser-repl-from-a-terminal)
* [`resources/public/`](resources/public/): SPA root directory;
[dev](#running-the-app) / [prod](#production) profile depends on the most recent build
  - [`index.html`](resources/public/index.html): SPA home page
    - Dynamic SPA content rendered in the following `div`:
        ```html
        <div id="app"></div>
        ```
    - Customizable; add headers, footers, links to other scripts and styles, etc.
  - Generated directories and files
    - Created on build with either the [dev](#running-the-app) or [prod](#production) profile
    - `js/compiled/`: compiled CLJS (`shadow-cljs`)
      - Not tracked in source control; see [`.gitignore`](.gitignore)
* [`src/cljs_fake_news/`](src/cljs_fake_news/): SPA source files (ClojureScript,
[re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame))
  - [`core.cljs`](src/cljs_fake_news/core.cljs): contains the SPA entry point, `init`

### Environment Setup

1. Install [JDK 8 or later](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) (Java Development Kit)
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (JavaScript runtime environment) which should include
   [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) or if your Node.js installation does not include NPM also install it.
5. Clone this repo and open a terminal in the `cljs-fake-news` project root directory
6. Run `npm install && npm start`
7. HTTP server available at http://localhost:8281
8. nREPL server will be on port 8777

## Development

### Running the App

Start a temporary local web server, build the app with the `dev` profile, and serve the app,
browser test runner and karma test runner with hot reload:

```sh
npm install
npx shadow-cljs watch app
```

Please be patient; it may take over 20 seconds to see any output, and over 40 seconds to complete.

When `[:app] Build completed` appears in the output, browse to
[http://localhost:8280/](http://localhost:8280/).

[`shadow-cljs`](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) will automatically push ClojureScript code
changes to your browser on save. To prevent a few common issues, see
[Hot Reload in ClojureScript: Things to avoid](https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2019/08/25/hot-reload-in-clojurescript.html#things-to-avoid).

Opening the app in your browser starts a
[ClojureScript browser REPL](https://clojurescript.org/reference/repl#using-the-browser-as-an-evaluation-environment),
to which you may now connect.
